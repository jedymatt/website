# Using XAMPP to Serve Laravel Apps

1. Edit Virtual Hosts

    ```properties [C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf]
    <!-- This is needed to keep the index of localhost same -->
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs"
        ServerName localhost
    </VirtualHost>
    
    <VirtualHost *:80>
        DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/PROJECT_NAME/public"
        ServerName PROJECT_NAME.test
     </VirtualHost>
    ```

    Note:

    `PROJECT_NAME.test` should be added in hosts file

2. Then restart Apache from XAMPP control panel

Additional Tips:

To serve on different port, for example port 5000:

```properties [C:/xampp/apache/conf/extra/httpd-vhosts.conf]
Listen 5000
<VirtualHost *:5000>
        DocumentRoot "C:/xampp/htdocs/PROJECT_NAME/public"
        ServerName PROJECT_NAME.test
</VirtualHost>
```
